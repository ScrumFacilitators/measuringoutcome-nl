# Measuring Outcome

**Hoi Scrum Facilitators!**

Welkom bij de 'MEasuring Outcome' wiki.

--todo: translate the rest / verder vertalen --

This game is based on Evidence-Based Management (EBM). EBM is an empirical framework which organizations can use to help measure the (perceived) product value and the way they deliver their product(s). The measurements can be inspected to help maximize product value and improve the way of working.

## The KVMs are not set in stone

Keep in mind that the KVMs are not set in stone. These are measures suggested from the EBM framework. During the game, you'll have opportunities to reflect on these KVMs, discuss and come up with new valuable KVMs yourself. 

## To make your life easier

To make life easier, we've included a manual on how to facilitate this exercise and a Cheat Sheet where all the Key Value Measures (KVMs) are explained so relax... Now you can focus totally on the exercise as a facilitator. 

## Releases

Use the **Release** to get the most stable and updated version of the Measuring Outcome Exercise. We'll promise to keep it updated ;-)
